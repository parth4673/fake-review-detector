# 🕵️ Fake Review Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake (spam) product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. It analyzes review text and classifies whether it is genuine or deceptive based on patterns learned from the data.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Detects fake vs genuine reviews using machine learning
- 🧠 Uses NLP techniques like TF-IDF vectorization
- 📊 Model training and evaluation using Scikit-learn
- 📈 Performance metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, precision & recall
- 📝 Clean and well-documented Jupyter notebook or Python script

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- PyCharm IDE

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset contains labeled product reviews as either `deceptive` or `truthful`.
- Features are extracted from the review text using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency).

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:parth4673/fake-review-detector.git
   cd fake-review-detector
